This project is built on the shoulders of giants - credits are going to:

- Hakim El Hattab for [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
- Shopify for [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid)
- W3C for [Unicorn](https://validator.w3.org/unicorn/?ucn_lang=en)
- All the community members which share their knowledge in blogs, forums and sites like [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/), [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org)...
