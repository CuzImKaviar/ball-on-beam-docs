This is your posts archive. You can list all your posts in chronological order by calling an include file with this notation: {% raw %}`{% include post-list-by-year.html %}`{% endraw %}. This include is also used on the 404 error page. For your blog you should delete this paragraph ;-)

{% include post-list-by-year.html %}
