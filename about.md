![Avatar]({{ site.data.authors[site.author].avatar }}){:.left.avatar} Hi, I am Ottmar Gobrecht, an Oracle Database developer living Munich, Germany. [HydeBar][2] is a free time project with the focus on delivering a solid, customizable foundation without any hidden blackbox except [Jekyll][1] itself. It can run on GitHub Pages with an initial setup time less than 5 minutes. This is possible by forking the project, renaming the repository to YourUserName.github.io and setting up the url/baseurl in `_config.yml`.
