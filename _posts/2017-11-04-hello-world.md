title: Hello World
subtitle: HydeBar, a Jekyll sidebar template with Reveal.js integration
tags: [jekyll, reveal]
lang: en
---

The Jekyll sidebar template is a fully responsive HTML5 theme/template for the site generator Jekyll. Except for the Reveal.js slideshow integration it needs no activated JavaScript on the client side. The sidebar is complete CSS driven.

{% include toc %}

The template has no dependencies on external plugins - therefore it can run on GitHub Pages. Except for the Jekyll blackbox itself (which renders your site) everything is implemented with Liquid templates located in the directories `_layout` and `_includes`. No hidden secrets :-)

## Features:

- Responsive, CSS driven sidebar
- Reveal.js slideshow integration
- Archive page
- Tag index
- Atom feed
- robots.txt, sitemap.xml
- 404 error page which shows the archive
- Multi author support

- Easy ToC creation: {% raw %}`{% include toc %}`{% endraw %}
- Disqus comments
- Google analytics
- Miss something? Create it, share it...
